# CourseShop
Project developed for [ItShare.ro](https://itshare.ro/cursuri) during the .NET Core classes
## Scope
The online shop theme of the project was chosen by students during the first few classes.
The course is going to break down each development step of the application, from the very start of a .NET Core Web App template to a fully working, customizable online store.
During the development of this app, students will learn basic web concepts, SQL Server and C# knowledge, and will also get accommodated with the production workflow. 

## Road map
TBD
